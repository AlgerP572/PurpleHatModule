# PurpleHatModule
A derivative work from Hans Tanner's Purple hat IOTT stick SW.  Supports OTA FW download and OTA logging.
Added ability to download FW over the air wirelessely so it can be updated in place on the layout.

Note: This is Purple hat only other hats have been removed and only a subset of the features are supprted.
This was to make flash memory space available for the the over the air FW download and over the air debug
logging.

# Measurements Folder
This folder contains various measurements I've made for the G-scale engines in the fleet.  The top level folder contains an excel template that documents the various steps for the profiling. i.e. Set high, mid, low speed control, CV29 bit 4, wheel diameter etc.  It also shows an overview of the pre-calibrated, speed table and post calibrated data. An example for the RhB 413 Krocodile is below:
